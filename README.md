# SongLib
This application will be used to create a song library with an associated GUI that will allow user to perform 3 actions:
  1. Add() a new song to the library,
  2. Edit() the fields of any existing song in the library,
  3. and Delete() any existing songs in the library.
The songs in this library will be stored int alphabetical order and will each hold the song's information such as song name, artist, album, and year.
